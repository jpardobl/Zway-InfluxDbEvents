# Zway-InfluxDbStats

Store sensor data in InfluxDB instances. Sensor and device data is transfered
periodically, as well as every time a change occurs.

Since this module uses the new line protocol, it requires at least InfluxDb
version 0.9.0.

Data is stored under 'device.$DeviceID$', with only one measurement key 
called 'level' The following tags are also added:

* probe: Probe title (eg. 'temperature')
* room: Room name
* scale: Scale title (eg. 'Â°C')
* type: Basic device type (eg. 'multilevelSensor')
* title: Device name
